# use the notes from while_Example.sh to run this one, you can modify it and see how a function() works in linux while loops and functions are in a lot of the code we use if you want to start writing
#example... you could add this bit to your .bashrc and have the function execute on command ( such as everytime you refresh )

#!/bin/bash

mydate(){

        echo "today is: "
        date
        echo " be safe ! "
}

## ANY ECHO POSTED HERE WILL GO BEFORE THE INITIAL OUTPUT

mydate
